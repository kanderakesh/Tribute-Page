        <h2>Early-life</h2>
        <p>
          Robert Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in New York City, USA. He
          comes from a family deeply rooted in the entertainment industry; his
          father, Robert Downey Sr., was a filmmaker, and his mother, Elsie Ann
          Ford, was an actress. As a child, Downey showed early interest in
          acting and made his film debut at the age of five in his father's
          film, "Pound." However, his upbringing was not without challenges. He
          struggled with substance abuse from a young age, which would later
          affect his career. Despite his personal struggles, Downey attended the
          Santa Monica High School and studied acting at the Stagedoor Manor
          Performing Arts Training Center. His talent shone through, and he
          gained recognition in the mid-1980s for roles in films like "Less Than
          Zero" and "The Pick-up Artist." Throughout his early career, he
          continued to battle addiction, which led to multiple arrests and
          stints in rehab. It wasn't until the late 1990s that he managed to
          overcome his demons and revive his acting career. Robert Downey Jr.'s
          early life was marked by both promise and turmoil, but his immense
          talent eventually propelled him to become one of Hollywood's most
          iconic actors, particularly known for his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man
          in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
